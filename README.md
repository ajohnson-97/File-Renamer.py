# THINGS TO ADD IN FUTURE UPDATES:
- Add regex parameters for renaming filters

# BUGS/ISSUES TO FIX:
- Improve readability with comments and better variable names
- Rewrite/refactor log file path widgets/functions.
    - Replace check button/dual radio buttons with two check buttons only for controlling the log path
      - 1st is generate a file true/false and default path is the working directory, second is choose a custom path which will override option 1 if selected.
