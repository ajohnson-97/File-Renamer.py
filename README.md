# File-Renamer.py
Batch rename files in a directory without whitespace, in TitleCase, based on file extension. <br> <br>
Written by Anthony Johnson

# THINGS TO ADD IN FUTURE UPDATES:
- Add more exception handling
- Add exception messages into the summary file
- Account for multiple naming conflicts in one folder and increment filenames correctly (currently working on this in the beta version)
- Add an option to specify keywords (like dates) (or wildcards) to enhance the programs ability to target and rename specific files
- Add an option to choose how you want the files to be formatted (including adding the date/time they were created into the filename or numbered/incremented etc...)
- Add an option to reject creating a summary file
- Make a GUI version with dropdown menus to select the input info and display verbose info in a pop-up console window or text box
- Add date/time to program, include in the summary log file so if theres multiple versions appended to one file, each iteration can have the date/time for reference

# BUGS TO FIX:
1. File extensions are being renamed in TitleCase
